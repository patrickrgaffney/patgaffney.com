    I’m Pat Gaffney, a software engineer in St. Louis. I studied computer science at a small college you’ve never heard of. Now I work as a <a href="https://www.ocelotconsulting.com/">software consultant</a> in the St. Louis area, primarily doing cloud application development. Before that, I wrote full-stack applications for a giant agricultural company. I write here from time to time about programming and open source projects I'm working on.
